"""Simplified BMSSP (Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Paths).

This *lite* version accepts an arbitrary set of sources S and returns regular
distance/predecessor/depth dictionaries for all vertices whose distance â‰¤
`bound`; vertices beyond the bound keep distance = inf so downstream code
continues to work.

Implementation: heap-based multi-source Dijkstra with early cutoff when the
current distance > bound.  Good enough for first integration; later we will
add Duan's pivot recursion.
